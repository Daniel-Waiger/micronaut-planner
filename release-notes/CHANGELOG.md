# Changelog

All notable changes to the Micronaut Planner web app are documented here.
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Reconstructed
retroactively — see [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) and
[TASKS.md](../../TASKS.md) for the day-to-day worklist this app was actually
built against; the version numbers below are annotated git tags placed on
that existing history, not a scheme that was tracked from day one.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.18.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- Imported project files are now shape-validated after migration, not just
  schema-migrated. A file that already claimed the current schema version
  used to skip every migration check and reach the app completely
  unvalidated; now it is checked either way. Files too damaged to use are
  rejected with the existing import error, and recoverable ones are
  sanitized -- the app tells you what was dropped. Malformed provenance
  entries, and entries that name a measurement the file doesn't actually
  have, are discarded, so a hand-edited file can no longer silently lock
  fields against later edits.
- The Restore menu can delete an individual saved recovery slot, and
  Settings has a two-click "Clear all stored data" action. Previously, a
  user whose browser storage was full was told so with no in-app way to
  free space -- the storage-full message now points at both.

### Changed
- 72 of the spectral pack's 157 fluorophore entries were checked against
  their cited vendor or publication sources and now carry a
  "source-cited" badge in place of "unreviewed" -- the remaining 85 are
  still the real review target. Family entries (LysoTracker, LIVE/DEAD,
  SYTO) stay claude-drafted on purpose: their uncovered sibling variants
  must not be certified by a family-level flag.
- The Fluorophores panel's review banner now describes that panel's own
  fluorophores instead of making a blanket claim -- a panel made up
  entirely of source-cited fluorophores no longer says it's unreviewed.
- Development: the documented `python3 tools/serve_dir.py web` command
  works again (it now generates `web/kb.dev.js` itself instead of
  importing a deleted script); the single-file build now refuses to
  bundle network primitives (fetch/XMLHttpRequest/WebSocket/sendBeacon/
  EventSource), so the app's no-network guarantee is enforced by the
  build rather than by convention; the naming template config moved to
  the engine layer so tests exercise the real one instead of a copy; and
  a new `tools/capture_screenshots.py` regenerates the app screenshots in
  `docs/images/`.

### Fixed
- The step rail's "Measurements" label no longer breaks mid-word when the
  status badge next to it leaves too little room -- it now wraps at a
  word boundary, or gives the badge its own line, instead.
- Review's Study map summary no longer shows a duplicated "Study map"
  heading directly above its own content.
- A measurement named the same as its own readout (e.g. "Bacterial
  viability") no longer echoes itself on Review's Study map summary --
  the readout is only shown when it adds information the label doesn't
  already give.
- The Release notes link now works when running the built single-file
  app or straight from disk, not only on the hosted site.

### Removed
- An unused, parallel Gemini-based agent pipeline
  (`tools/antigravity-multi-agent/`) and the repo's only third-party
  dependency list; leftover files from the archived Streamlit-era app;
  six dead exports; and ARL, a placeholder marker with no known
  identity.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- The step rail's New study and Walkthrough labels were rendering in muted
  grey on their own accent fills -- Walkthrough's was about 1.4:1 against its
  solid teal, effectively invisible until hovered. Both now use their
  intended ink (at least 5.1:1 in light, 6.0:1 in dark).
- The step navigation rail no longer disappears or scrolls out of reach at
  high browser zoom. Below 900px it now narrows to an icon-only column
  (matching every other width) instead of turning into a horizontal strip
  that pushed Settings, Feedback, Release notes and Theme off-screen; below
  760px it no longer removes the rail outright, which had made those same
  four controls completely unreachable on narrow screens or heavy zoom.
- Settings, Feedback, Release notes and Theme now sit flush against the
  bottom of the screen, instead of hanging up to 22px below the fold.

### Changed
- The step rail's buttons are smaller and less boxy. Step items lost their
  44px floor and now size to their own content, and the control panel's six
  buttons (New study, Walkthrough, Settings, Feedback, Release notes, Theme)
  are a compact cluster rather than six more full-size step rows — so the
  whole rail now fits an ordinary laptop screen without scrolling. Touch
  devices keep the larger 44px targets.
- Settings and Feedback in the step rail's control panel switched from fixed
  saturated colors to the same neutral surface (accent-highlighted only when
  open) as every other step button.
- The narrow-screen navigation strip (with its own New study/Walkthrough
  buttons and measurement/step dropdowns) is removed; the icon-only rail
  above now covers every width down to a phone screen.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- A version tag on the Settings page, and this release notes page.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- The walkthrough dialog no longer merges into the app's own footer.
- A missing favicon — the browser tab and bookmark icon are now set.
- Background UI interactions are blocked during the feature tour.
- The sticky footer no longer shows ghost controls through toasts, and silent
  operations no longer trigger one.
- Study groups are asked for once, on the measurement that actually uses
  them, instead of repeating the prompt.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-03

### Changed
- **Pilot-readiness restructure.** One front door: the onboarding modal is
  gone, the feature tour no longer starts itself, and a first run starts
  blank rather than inside the shipped example.
- Ten routes became five plus three utilities: Study map, Research brief,
  Measurements (a searchable registry), the measurement you opened, and
  Review.
- One status vocabulary reaches the user — Draft, Needs a decision, Ready to
  acquire — while conformance remains the sole export gate.
- **The LLM seam closed, not deferred.** The in-app model path was removed
  rather than finished; the one remaining path is one-way — "Copy prompt for
  your own LLM" hands the researcher a block for whatever model they already
  use, and nothing it produces is parsed back into the study.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- An orientation step that helps researchers orient around their study plan.
- Improved feedback handoff and walkthrough.
- A collapsed theme bulb toggle for switching color mode from the nav.

### Fixed
- The guided workflow and naming inputs are usable again.
- A duplicate study map comparison prompt no longer appears.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-23

### Changed
- A refreshed product-designer UI.
- Contextual microscopy icons throughout the app.
- The study planning workflow was redesigned and now guides the user through
  it explicitly.
- The project description review workspace was unified into one page.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Zen-planner reframe.** Home/walkthrough, a phased interview, a
  name-builder-style Microscopy grid, schedule export, and a searchable wiki.
- An onboarding stage router and local-model auto-detect.

Retired in 0.15.0, which removed the onboarding gate this introduced.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- An interactive spectral panel and fluorophore picker.
- Expanded fluorophore coverage.
- The color panel patch: per-fluorophore colors and a default filter
  suggestion.

### Fixed
- Fluorophore-picker alignment, per-fluorophore emission-curve width, and
  filter/color defaults refreshing correctly on pick.
- The spectrum chart's height and text no longer distort as its width
  changes.
- Sticky/collapsible step nav, with full-height layout and monochrome icons.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Opt-in local LLM.** Step guidance and study drafting into a fresh tab,
  via a locally running Ollama model.
- A chat-LLM round trip for zero-setup users: copy a prompt, paste the
  model's JSON back in.
- Reviewing model proposals into an in-progress study.

### Fixed
- Ollama's context is capped so a model fits in GPU VRAM, and it unloads on
  tab close.
- Validation error messages are now plain language.

Retired in 0.15.0, which closed the in-app LLM seam entirely in favor of a
one-way copy-prompt handoff.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Alpha-pilot-readiness, Waves 0-2.**
  - Wave 0: fixes from an xhigh code review of the four preceding
    milestones — Color panel family-variant dedupe and alias tokenizing, a
    new `panel.derived.hasAntibody` fact so controls rules stop firing
    without an antibody involved, a new FMO control rule, a tested deploy
    pipeline, and knowledge-pack gaps filled in.
  - Wave 1: a "Copy feedback report" button (step, browser, KB health, full
    study, all as text) and a GitHub issues link.
  - Wave 2: structured panel assembly (a real `panel.channels` editor), a
    bench card export, a whole-study conformance check, and "Export for your
    own LLM" — a copy-paste prompt for whatever model the researcher already
    has open.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- CSV and JSON study exports: a per-planned-filename file manifest and a
  full-fidelity JSON dump of the study document.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- A fluorophore / color panel step: a qualitative spectral-spillover advisor
  over the active assay's markers field.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- An in-app Guide step.
- A GitHub Pages auto-deploy workflow.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- A study overview step: a shareable study diagram (HTML and an in-app SVG
  map), a deterministic walkthrough, and a staged progression ladder (idea to
  advanced modality).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- **The assay tier (schema v3).** A study can hold several assays that share
  only a research question and a test article, each with its own modality,
  panel, and specimen — the real Romo-Rico et al. oregano study became the
  app's default. N-assay UI, readout and controls vocabulary, and an
  exportable design document shipped across four commits.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- Modality advice: 16 rules across STED, confocal, widefield, light-sheet,
  SEM-TEM, and Raman, surfaced on the Describe, Design, and Naming steps —
  each note shows why it fired, not just what it says.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- P1 vertical slice: the knowledge-pack loader, a predicate DSL, the
  interview engine, deterministic free-text ingest, and a condition matrix
  that resolves to sample IDs — a full paragraph-to-filenames path.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- P0 vertical slice: the experiment schema, naming/validation ports, the
  single-file inliner, the store with tiered provenance, the app shell, and
  persistence — a working name-builder that runs from `file://`.
